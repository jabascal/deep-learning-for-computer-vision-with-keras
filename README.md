# deep-learning-for-computer-vision-with-keras

Googlecolab notebooks to solve several computer vision problems using deep learning with with Python and keras. 

See contents.ipynb:

- **Image classification with transfer learning:** Image classification using transfer learning and fine tuning on the flowers dataset.
  
- **Image classification with ensemble learning:** We combine several models using ensemble methods.  Adversarial attacks and adversarial training: We study adversarial examples and assess the effect of different adversarial attacks and adversaril training.

- **Adversarial attacks and adversarial training:** We study adversarial examples and assess the effect of different adversarial attacks and adversaril training.
