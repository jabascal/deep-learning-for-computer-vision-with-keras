# deep-learning-for-computer-vision-with-keras

Googlecolab notebooks to solve several computer vision problems using deep learning with with Python and keras. 

## Contents: 

- **[Image classification with transfer learning](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hmxD6mAJaa6iSZd0oQoCSFbwvHmzjoit#scrollTo=3Gl9vcdgAois):** Image classification using transfer learning and fine tuning, on the flowers dataset, and a short error analysis. Final model is also applied to custom photos.

- **[Image classification with ensemble learning](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BZf8HpoKrQquvowe0Yh-68u8Ne5lCjsp#scrollTo=3Gl9vcdgAois):** We combine several models using ensemble methods.  

- **[Adversarial attacks and adversarial training](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Xzt-GrYhE9xF382YJMDKc7SZQ9NA6IyM#scrollTo=HxNmcxcnuQSg):** We study adversarial examples and assess the effect of different adversarial attacks and adversaril training.
